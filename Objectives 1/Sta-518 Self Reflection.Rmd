# STA 518 Objectives:-

## 1.Import, manage, and clean data:-

I can import data from a variety of sources.

```{r}
# Read TXT files with read.table()
ftxt <- read.table("https://alexd106.github.io/intro2R/data/children.txt", 
                 header = TRUE)
ftxt

# Read in csv files with read_csv()
college_grades<- read_csv("data/recent-grads.csv")
college_grades

# Read in xlsx files with read_excel()
fxlsx <- read_excel("data/loyn.xlsx")
fxlsx
```

I can isolate information from a larger data source.

```{r}

```
